### Networking Guide

Building your network can seem daunting and it takes time. We suggest you follow a plan such as this to start building your network so you are ready when it comes time to look for jobs.

Try finding resources and ideas on your own, some google prompts might be:

- How to network remotely for tech
- How to reach out for a coffee chat
- How to find remote hackathons

I suggest making a plan where you do one thing a week. You can follow the plan below or create your own. The important thing is that you are actively working on connecting to folks now.

Week:

1. Sign up for Women Who Code, and add their slack channel
2. Find another group that speaks to you, to mention a few Out In Tech, Techqueria, Women of Color in Tech.
   a. Try googling “Tech slack group for {your identity}” and see what comes up
3. Create a meetup account and join 2 local groups
4. Check the events for all your new groups and sign up for 1 in-person or remote networking event
   a. If you are feeling awkward about networking here are some great tips from [Science Of People](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/networking/)
   b. Get at least 3 names and linkedin profiles
   i. It is really convenient when you have the LinkedIn app pulled up on your phone, then you can just hand your phone to folks and they can type in their names.
   ii. If it is a remote event often people will put their LinkedIn in the the chat, or you can take note of the folks asking questions or speaking and connect with them.
   iii. It can be helpful to add a message about where you connected with them so you will remember later like : “Hi {name}, I was so nice meeting you at the {event}!”
5. Reach out to one of your new connections for an informal coffee chat (sometimes called an informal interview)
   a. Google what a coffee chat is, and how to best prepare for one.
6. Comment in your slack groups about a post or comment.
7. Start a conversation in one of your slack groups - you can link an interesting article, start a topic of conversation, or something else.
8. Google for hackathons either virtually or in your area - sign up for one.
9. Look for tech conferences and find one or two you are interested in, often they will offer free or discounted tickets for students
10. Repeat one of the steps above
11. Repeat one of the steps above
12. Repeat one of the steps above
13. Repeat one of the steps above
14. Repeat one of the steps above
15. Repeat one of the steps above
16. Repeat one of the steps above
17. Repeat one of the steps above
18. Repeat one of the steps above
19. Repeat one of the steps above
20. Download all your LinkedIn contacts (you can download a CSV file, google directions) for each contact find the careers or jobs site for their company and save the link. Go through every week or two to see if a company is hiring.
21. Repeat one of the steps above

### How Not to Network at a Conference

Sometimes conferences will have lists of companies that will be attending and even the representatives. Connect with the reps who's companies you are interested in and build genuine rapport with them before attending your conference. That way when you see them at the conference you can connect and it'll be easier to talk because you've already "broken the ice."

Some conferences have a forum for you to make yourself a profile similar in concept to LinkedIn that recruiters and employers can look at and pool from. Get that up there as soon as possible and make sure its quality.

Also try to look up any events/sessions in advance so you know which themes will be discussed, do some moderate research on topics you are interested in but know nothing about.

- Connect with and message the speakers - same spiel as with the company reps - connect, build rapport, and reconnect when you get to the conference.
- Knowing which events are given and when (if they have sessions running concurrently) will let you build your "attendance schedule" or plan out which ones you want to attend.
- Make a point to connect at something is fun for you!

While attending, if there's ever an awkward moment and you have the opportunity to speak with someone...ask them about what they've enjoyed or are looking forward to. Or you can talk about the food selection, hehe! I also just genuinely suck at small talk and don't like it too much, here's a [list of questions](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/questions-to-ask-at-a-networking-event) you might find helpful.

Decide what is the best way to connect for you. How will you follow up with people? I want to say techies are phasing out business cards, but it may be helpful to get a few dozen made if possible. LinkedIn, email, etc

Decide on a way to take notes if needed or use your contacts app. While you may not be exchanging phone numbers, you can save their contact details as well as write notes about anything that reminds you of the encounter, anything they've said, or anything you'd like to follow up about.

### Motivation

At some point in our careers, every one of us will need to ask others for feedback, connections, or support. The more you can build and manage your network, the better you'll be able to identify, explore, and achieve your desired career goals. With the right strategies, networking can be enjoyable and advantageous. A wider network increases your chances to explore different career paths, express your skills, and understand various roles (like those of SWEs and non-SWEs). It is crucial for job searching and one of the most important strategies for career advancement.

Benefits of networking:

- Generation of referrals/increased business
- Opportunities
  - With a motivated group of people comes an abundance of opportunities! There are always lots of opportunities that come from networking!
- Connections
  - Networking provides you with a great source of connections and really opens the door to talk to highly influential people that you wouldn’t otherwise be able to easily talk to or find.
- Raising your profile
  - Being visible and getting noticed is a big benefit of networking. You can then help to build your reputation as a knowledgeable, reliable, and supportive person by offering useful information or tips to people who need it. You are also more likely to get more leads and referrals as you will be the one that pops into their head when they need what you offer.

### Lesson

Everyone has something to offer others. The key to networking is offering up something of value that you possess, that others want. This doesn't need to be a technical skill, it can be something as simple as giving out great restaurant recommendations or being a great listener.

## Step 1: Define Your Career Aspirations & Networking Goals

Take some time to make a list of the things that are great about YOU - your superpowers. For example, a list might look like:

- Great at throwing parties
- Good with kids
- Fiscally responsible
- Fast learner (e.g., new programming languages, frameworks)

Now that you have your list of superpowers, think about what you want out of your future network, especially concerning your career. Do you want to learn more about a particular industry (e.g., fintech, healthcare tech)? Are you curious about specific roles like Frontend Designer, Full-Stack Developer, or even non-SWE roles that interact with tech teams? Do you want to find an internship, a job, or understand the differences between SWE levels (e.g., P1 vs P3)?

Get clear on your career-related learning goals and what unique perspectives or skills (your superpowers) you can offer in conversations.

## Step 2: Do some research on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter (or X)

Focus your research on individuals, companies, and groups related to the career interests you identified in Step 1. Look for people holding roles you're interested in (e.g., Mobile Developer, WordPress Developer, Product Manager) and observe what they discuss and what communities they are part of. Subscribe to relevant email lists, introduce yourself in group chats, and follow people you admire. Consider this research as a precursor to potentially booking "informational chats" or "coffee chats" to learn more.

Join all the groups! Subscribe to all the email lists! You never know what you might gravitate towards or who you might meet, and you can always pare down later.

## Step 3: Get involved - network online

Now that you've joined groups on LinkedIn and Facebook and followed your heroes on Twitter (or X), engage in a few conversations. Introduce yourself, comment on a few others' posts, and make a goal to participate in one way or another at least twice a week to get started. It can be helpful to set a calendar alert or alarm to do your regular posting.

When engaging, tailor your questions and contributions to learn more about specific roles or to offer value to people in your target fields. For example, if you're interested in understanding how a Product Manager interacts with SWEs, look for opportunities to ask such questions in relevant forums. A like or a share isn't the same thing as engaging in meaningful conversation or sharing your unique point of view. Focus on sharing something of value or adding your perspective to build relationships.

## Step 4: Get involved - network in person

First things first - find your event. Meetup.com can be a great place, as well as any events created from the LinkedIn or Facebook groups you joined.

Networking at an in-person event can be daunting for those new to networking. Going with a clear goal in mind (from Step 1) as well as some prepared topics, can make it A LOT easier.

One great goal (even if you aren't sure of your career goals yet) is to meet 3 new people, no matter what kind of industry they might be in. If you get better and better at this, another expert-level goal is to spend no longer than 3 minutes speaking with each person and speak with as many people as you can. Challenge yourself!

Science of People has some excellent tips for where to stand, how to show you're listening with a head tilt, remembering people's names, giving handshakes, what to wear, etc.

**Here's a list of questions to memorize (or write down and carry with you):**

- What do you do?
- How long have you been doing it?
- How do you like it?
- What's a typical day/week like in your role?
- How did you get involved in it?
- What kind of projects are you working on right now?
- What’s your favorite part of the job?
- What skills are most crucial for success in your area?
- How does your role interact with software engineers or other technical teams?
- What advice would you give to someone interested in pursuing a similar career path?

**And to get OUT of a conversation, here are some wrap-up questions:**

- What’s next for you in your career?
- How can I help you meet your goals? (This is where your 'superpowers' and genuine interest can shine, even if you're early in your career.)
- Would you like to keep in touch?

**If you get stuck in a conversation at a networking event:**

- Stick out your hand and shake the person’s hand or touch their arm while saying, “It was great meeting you.”
- Say, “Let’s mingle some more,” and walk away.
- Say, “I see someone I need to talk to.”

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

Networking is supposed to be brief - don't expect someone to spend the entire event talking to you, and don't be surprised if they move on really quickly (read: 10 or 20 seconds). It's not personal, and it's not about you - it's about them and what they need. So stay confident in yourself and move on to the next potential connection.

Also, you don't need to spend money on business cards or pay to go to a fancy event to build your connections. Bring a stack of Post-it notes with your name and email address pre-written on a few and a pen, or bring your phone with LinkedIn ready to search for your new connections.

### Guided Practice

Grab a partner and have a practice conversation using the questions in Step 4.

### Independent Practice (Focus on Career Exploration)

Spend at least 2x per week participating in your social media groups, and set small goals for yourself. For example, invite someone to directly message you for help with something you're good at. Offer up your superpowers regularly, and don't be afraid to ask for help yourself.

### Challenge

Introverted? Challenge yourself to get involved often enough in an online group that you make a real friend. Then, challenge yourself further by inviting that friend to attend an in-person event together.

Extroverted? Challenge yourself by going to in-person events and spending no longer than 30 seconds talking to each person. Set a new record for yourself each time you attend an event.

### Make your own networking plan for the next 6 months

The important thing about networking is that you do a little something to grow your reach every week. Using what you now know and what you know you need to practice, make a 6-month plan. Ensure your plan includes specific actions to network towards the career interests you've identified. For example, "Attend X meetups related to [target industry/role like Frontend Development]" or "Conduct Y informational interviews with people in [target role like Staff Engineer or Product Management]." [Here is an example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FCIN9NV03wDSfXj9TOBbZZI_S-hkDeLhhyfMgqwm0z0) you can copy and work off of.

### Check for Understanding

Find a partner and discuss the following:

- What are some of the benefits of networking?
- What are some questions you can ask to open up a conversation? How can you wrap up a conversation?
- How can you make connections online?
- Briefly discuss your respective superpowers.
- Ideally, what would you like to gain from your future network? What are your goals?
- How can networking help you understand the differences between various software engineering levels (e.g., SWE I vs. Senior SWE) or different tech career paths (e.g., Frontend vs. Backend vs. Full-Stack)?
- What kind of questions would you ask in an informational chat with someone in a role you're interested in, based on what you learned about identifying career interests?

### Summary (plus quick tips and tricks)

- Set goals for new connections. Try competing with friends.
- Names should be written clearly and as large as possible on name tags at events to avoid awkward squinting.
- Add pronouns to your name tag if you think that'll make it easier for people.
- Make a second name tag that says, "Ask me about **\_**."
- Wave at people you know and then either avoid them or take them along with you to meet new people.
- When you learn a new name, take the time to really learn it by thinking of someone else with a similar name or something that rhymes with it, etc., OR write it down immediately on a post-it. No one is really "bad at names."
- **Align your interactions with your career goals:** When meeting someone, think about how this connection might help you learn about or move towards your desired career path, and how you might offer value in return.
